;; DONE[No problem]: BUG: Adding bookmark under head node is wrong, two bookmarks will be added.
;; DONE: BUGS on history bookmark: all projects share a single scb-jump-history during a session. Should be when open a project, this project's bookmark should be loaded.
;; TODO: BUGS: 1.[FIXED] when history is saved into file, the current positon of bookmark is not saved. 2.[FIXED] If there are two subtree under the head node, then after enter a subtree by "\C-q i", you can not enter to another subtree. The problem is, you can not back to head node. 3. Even a file is not in the current projcet, it will be added to history when jumping.
;; DONE: After open a project, jump to the current history bookmark.

;; DONE: BUGS on history bookmark: 1.[FIXED] The first bookmark can't be deleted. 2[FIXED]. When deleted the last bookmark, then you can't jump to the previous bookmark because scb-jump-current is set to nil.

;; DONE: Add save history in a file.
;; DONE: calculate line count of a file in elisp instead of call "wc" command.

;; DONE: jump history not save the current position before jump, it only save the goto position.

;; TODO: the jump history function can be extracted as a single file.
;; DONE: Maybe we can use equal to compare elements in the tree, then access to a element will much easier(random access). If a same element is added(this will not happen, since every element has a current time element), first delete the original element, and then add the element at current position.
